### Project Overview
This project focuses on building a content-based movie recommendation system and integrating it with a chatbot interface. The recommendation system utilizes the content features of movies, such as genres, actors, and plot summaries, to suggest similar movies to users. The chatbot allows users to interact with the recommendation system and receive personalized movie recommendations based on their preferences.
